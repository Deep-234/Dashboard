# Dashboard
This is just a simple responsive dashboard with the use of HTML/CSS without using any Internet code like Bootstrap or something.
For responsive i use Media Queries and i made 2 simple html and css files and implement them.
In HTML, i implement regular libraries ,without any external libraries. except the script file for css.
In CSS i use basic funtion and media queries for responsiveness and later i implement this in HTML file.
